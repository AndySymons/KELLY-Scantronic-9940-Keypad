# KELLY-Scantronic-9940-Keypad
Integrates the Scantronic 9940 Keypad into ESPHome and Home Assistant 

The plan is to reverse-engineer the protocol between the alarm controller and the keypad using samples of each. 

##Â Status at 19 June 2024 

With an oscilloscope I can see that Scantronic 9940 Keypad uses a serial protocol a little like I2C but without the ACK bit and running at just 2kHz. It runs at Vcc voltage levels -- nominally 12V but more like 14V on my sample alarm controller using the original power supply (that makes sense because there is a 12V backup battery, which would go up to about 13.8V). 

I am building two line drivers with P82B96 bus interface chips, which can make the voltage conversion between Vcc (up to 15V) and the 3V3 logiv levels used by ESP32 microprocessors. 

My circuits are based on [Philips application note AN460](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/13528/AN460_P82B96.pdf) figs 4 and 7.

For optocouplers I am using the PC817, which is adequate for this low frequency application. 

Either line driver circuit can be used in the final solution -- I will make up my mind after playing with them for a while. the optocoupler solution appears more robust, but takes up more board space and is not strictly necessary because the keypad is powered by the controller, not a separate supply, so Vcc and Ground are shared anyway. 

To reverse engineer the protocol, I plan to connect them back to back between the sample control and keypad. The one with optocouplers (fig 4) separates Tx and Rx so I can see traffic in both directions. I will then use four channels of a cheap logic analyser to get more info on the protocol in both directions. I do not know yet, for example, whether the master or the slave provides the clock signal for keypad responses.

It is a part-time project, so could take a while; but watch this space, and please share any info you may have on this subject :-)
